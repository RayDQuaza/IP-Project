        <h3 align="left">What is Global Warming?</h3></font>
        <p>Global Warming is when the earth heats up(the temperature rises). It happens when greenhouse gases 
        <B>(carbon dioxide, water vapour, nitrous oxide, and methane)</B>trap heat and light from the sun in the earth's atmosphere, which 
        increases the temperature. This hurts many people, animals, and plants. Many cannot take the change, so they die.</p>

        <h3 align="left">what cause global warming?</h3>
        </font>
        <p>Many things cause global warming. One thing that causes global warming is electrical pollution.<B><I>Elecricity causes pollution in
        many ways, some worse than others.</I></B> In most cases, fossil fuels are burned to create electricity. Fossil fuels are made of dead 
        plants and animals. Some examples of fossil fuels are oil and petroleum. Many pollutants(chemicals that pollutre the air, water, and 
        land) are sent into the air when fossil fuels are burned. Some of these chemicals are called greenhouse gasses. We use these sources
        of energy much more than the sources that give off less pollution. Petroleum, one of the sources of energy, is used a lot.</p>

        <h3 align="left">What are people doing to stop global warming?</h3>
        </font>
        <P> People are doing many things to try to stop global warming:
        <ul type="Disc">
        <li>
        One thing people are doing is carpooling. Carpooling is driving with someone to a place that you are both going to. this minimizes the 
        amount of greenhouse gases put into air.
        </li>
        <li>
        Another thing that poeple are doing is being more careful about leaving things turned on like television, computer, and the lights. This 
        helps our planet.
        </li>
        <li>
        More people are riding buses, walking to school, and riding their bikes to lower the amount of greenhouse gases in the air
        </li>
        <li>
        Planting trees and recycling also helps. If you recycle, less trash goes to the dump, and less trash gets burned. As a result, there are 
        fewer greenhouse gases in the atmosphere.
        </li>
        <li>
        Watch what you buy. Many things, such as hairsray and deodorant, now are made to have less of an impact on the atmosphere. Less 
        greenhouse gases will rise into the air, and global warming will slow down.
        </li>
        </ul>
        </P>
